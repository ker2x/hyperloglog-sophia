		# This is an implementation of HyperLogLog that allows for querying counts
		# within time ranges of the form (t, current_time] with second-level
		# granularity. The standard implementation of HyperLogLog stores the max
		# number of leading zeros seen in the image of each of 2 ** b hash 
		# functions. These counts can naturally be stored in a string of length
		# 2 ** b by allocating one byte per leading zero count.
		#
		# To provide counts within a time range, we alter the standard
		# implementation to store a mapping of pairs of the form (hash function,
		# leading zero count) -> timestamp, where the mapping (h,z) -> t represents
		# the fact that we observed z leading zeros in the image of hash function h
		# most recently at time t. This mapping is stored in a string by packing
		# 4-byte words (timestamps, represented in seconds since the epoch) into
		# a matrix indexed by hash function and zero count stored in row-major
		# order. Since the max zero count for a counter with parameter b is (32-b),
		# this representation takes up at most 4 * (32-b) * (2 ** b) bytes (and
		# usually much less, since we don't allocate space for rows corresponding
		# to higher leading zero counts until they're actaully observed.)
		#
		# To convert this representation to a HyperLogLog counter for the time
		# range (t, current_time], we simply filter out all timestamps less than t
		# in the matrix and then find, for each hash function, the maximum z for 
		# which that hash function has a non-zero timestamp.
